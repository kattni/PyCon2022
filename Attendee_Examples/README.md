# PyCon 2022 Attendee Examples

This directory is available for PyCon 2022 attendees to contribute their own examples to this
repository. Please make a pull request on GitHub if you have an example you'd like to submit!

_If you are unfamiliar with using Git and GitHub, there is a guide available on the Adafruit
Learning System called [Contribute to CircuitPython Using Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) that covers a solid basic workflow. If
anything is still unclear, feel free to ask any of the CircuitPython folks for assistance!_

**Please update the README with a name for and short description of your example as shown below!**
